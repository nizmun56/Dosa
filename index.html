   <p> Dosa is a popular South Indian dish that is typically served for breakfast or as a snack. It is a pancake made from rice flour and ground pulses, and is usually served with a spiced vegetable filling1. The dish is famous for its simple ingredients and savory, slightly bitter flavor2.
    The crispy and crepe-like texture of dosa makes it a popular street food in India. It can be enjoyed with various fillings and sauces, such as potato, cheese, and chutneys2.
    To make dosa, a mixture of rice flour and black gram flour is used as the base of the batter. The batter is then fermented and spread thinly on a hot griddle or tava. Once cooked, the dosa is served hot and crispy2.</p>
    <h1> How does it taste</h1>

    <p>What does dosa taste like exactly? As described, it's a thin, crisp crepe or pancake. It has a slight tangy taste due to the fermentation, and is savory rather than sweet. Without the filling, on its own it's called 'plain dosa' that can be eaten with a variety of vegetable curries

   <p>Traditionally, dosa is served with a bowl of sambar and coconut chutney on the side. Some darshinis also serve a spicy tomato chutney along with the other accompaniments.</p>
   <h1> How to eat Dosa</h1> 
   <hr color="blue" size=10 width=75%>
   <p> Since Dosa is typically a street food, it's easy to take and eat on the go. In fact, it's customary in the Indian culture to eat Dosa with your hands! I like to tear it off and eat it in small bites. ... If it's served with chutney, you can use a knife to spread some over your Dosa and eat it bit by bit.</p>
   <h1> Why I like it</h1>

   <p>Dosa is famous for its simple ingredients, interesting flavors, and even its sweet aroma. I love it for how easy and clean the ingredients are. It can be eaten as a snack, as breakfast, or really anytime you're in the mood! Originating in southern India, Dosa has been around since the 5th century AD.></p>
